## 1. array_reverse

#### Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the provided array argument with elements in reversed order.

#### White Board

<a id="array_shift"></a>
## 2. array_shift

#### Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

#### White Board

<a id="array_binary_search"></a>
## 3. array_binary_search

#### Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

<a id="array_adjacent_product"></a>
## array_adjacent_product

#### 4. Challenge
Write a function called LargestProduct which takes in a 2D array, of arbitrary size.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the largest product of 2 adjacent values within the 2D array.
Adjacent values might be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally connected.

<a id="matrix_rotation"></a>
## 5. matrix_rotation

#### Challenge
Ask the candidate to write a function to rotate a 3x3 matrix (an array of integers), by 90 degrees clockwise.
Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language.
Don’t let the candidate get scared by the term “matrix”… It’s just an array of arrays.

<a id="ll_insertions"></a>
## 6. ll_insertions

#### Challenge
.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

<a id="ll_kth_from_end"></a>
## 7. ll_kth_from_end

#### Challenge
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges. ​

<a id="ll_merge"></a>
## 8. ll_merge.

#### Challenge
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the single list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

<a id="ll_detect_loop"></a>
## 9. ll_detect_loop.

#### Challenge
Write a method for the Linked List class called hasLoop which takes no arguments. Return a boolean that indicates whether or not a circular reference or loop is present in the linked list. Your implementation must not use any additional memory or modify the nodes of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the standard properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
Note: Length or Size are *not* included in standard properties for a LL.

<a id="detect_palendrome"></a>
## 10. detect_palendrome.

#### Challenge
Ask the candidate to write a function to validate whether or not a Linked list is palindrome
Help the candidate understand the definition of a Palindrome if he/she is unsure of it.
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of nodes which reads the same backward as forward.
Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available in your language.
This problem can be solved using different approaches:
Using a helper data structure (Array or Linked List) to keep track of the nodes.
This method takes O(n) and uses O(n) extra space.
Reversing the Linked List, and checking for equality of the reversed part.
