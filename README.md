## 1. array_reverse

#### Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the provided array argument with elements in reversed order.

## 2. array_shift

#### Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

<a id="array_binary_search"></a>
## 3. array_binary_search

#### Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

<a id="array_adjacent_product"></a>
## array_adjacent_product

#### 4. Challenge
Write a function called LargestProduct which takes in a 2D array, of arbitrary size.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the largest product of 2 adjacent values within the 2D array.
Adjacent values might be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally connected.

<a id="matrix_rotation"></a>
## 5. matrix_rotation

#### Challenge
Ask the candidate to write a function to rotate a 3x3 matrix (an array of integers), by 90 degrees clockwise.
Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language.
Don’t let the candidate get scared by the term “matrix”… It’s just an array of arrays.

<a id="ll_insertions"></a>
## 6. ll_insertions

#### Challenge
.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

<a id="ll_kth_from_end"></a>
## 7. ll_kth_from_end

#### Challenge
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges. ​
